# node-jekyll

A partial rewrite of Jekyll in NodeJS. This was created for a particular project where installing the real Jekyll and Ruby gems was extremely difficult/impossible.

This version currently only implements layouts and variables as this is all that was required for the project. I welcome any additions if more use is found for this package, or if someone wishes to take over development of this project please contact via the website on my profile page.
